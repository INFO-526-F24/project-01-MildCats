# Introduction

## The Why

-   All of us are avid sports fans (like most of you!)

-   Modern sports, especially those which have large fan-bases around the world are data-rich

-   The English Premier League is the most watched football (soccer) league in the world (Over 3 billion viewers every season)

-   Large publicly available supplementary data-sets (weather, betting odds etc.)

## The What

-   We focus on 2 key variables in our analysis -

    -   Weather

    -   Betting Odds

-   Our main motivation is to identify whether these variables can be accurate predictors of match outcomes

-   We also examine secondary relationships like -

    -   *"Whether referee decisions are uniformly distributed or can bias be quantitatively established ?"*

# The Data

## Overview

| Data         | Dimensions | Source                 | Key Data Points                           |
|--------------|------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Match Data   | 760 x 6    | TidyTuesday Repository | Final Result, Home/Away Goals             |
| Betting Odds | 760 x 12   | FootballData UK        | Betting Odds from Various Bookmakers      |
| Weather      | 760 x 20   | Openweather API et al. | Temperature, Precipitation, Humidity etc. |

-   All data was sourced from publicly available, free to use APIs and archives

-   The original tidytuesday dataset contained data for the 2021-22 season only, we found the data for subsequent seasons published by the same author

# EDA Highlights

## Setting Up the Main Dataset

-   One of the key challenges was to extend and merge the datasets together into one main data source to power our Shiny App

-   It is worth going through a few basic terms and what they mean -

    -   Odds - Fractional - Represent the fractional payout - Example - 5 or 5/1 means 5 times the wagered amount would be paid out if the bet is won

    -   Let us take a quick look at the raw data before we proceed

## Expectations vs Reality

-   Going into this project, we had certain pre-conceived notions around the correlation between betting odds and match results

-   Our intial EDA revealed results that were in line with our expectations - Pre-match odds were accurate indicators of match results

-   Weather has limited, but observable impact on match outcomes - A higher probability of an upset in extreme weather

# Visualizations (Switch to Shiny App)

# Conclusion

## Conclusion and Future Work 

-   Visual evidence of correlation between betting odds and match results

-   Referee bias was not conclusively found in this analysis

-   This is not a perfectly quantitative analysis as we were more focused on visualizations

    -   But future work could include a more quantitative, stats-heavy approach to answering these questions
