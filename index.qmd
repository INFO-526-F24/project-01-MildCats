## Abstract

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data from the English Premier League (soccer), covering the 2021-2023 seasons. Using match data as the core data-set, the analysis incorporates additional weather and betting odds data to explore various factors that may influence game outcomes.

We aim to uncover patterns such as home ground advantage, the impact of weather on match results, and the relationship between pre-published betting odds and actual outcomes.

The project prioritizes accessibility by presenting the findings in an engaging and easy-to-understand format for a wider audience.
